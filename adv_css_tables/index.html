        <h2>A History of Video Games and Console Generations</h2>
        <p>Gaming. An honored pastime. It’s not for everyone, but it has a massive fan base.
            Growing up, I found it amazing that I could escape into another world, and what did I find? Adventure! You could be whatever, do whatever, and really immerse yourself into another dimension. My first memory of playing was an NES (or the Original Nintendo Entertainment System). Soon I was discovering those that came before like the Atari and Sega game systems. I moved on through my childhood with the Super Nintendo, N64, and the PS1 (Original Playstation System). It didn’t matter what came first or last in the timeline of consoles. I loved them all! People have been gaming for years before most people even realize it!
        </p>
            <p>As early as 1950, computer scientists were using electronic machines to construct relatively simple game systems, such as Bertie the Brain in 1950 to play tic tac toe or Nimrod in 1951 for playing Nim. These systems used either electronic light displays or mainly as demonstration systems at large exhibitions to showcase the power of computers at the time. Another early demonstration was Tennis for Two, a game created by William Higinbotham at Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1958 for a three-day exhibition, using an analog computer and an oscilloscope for a display.
            Spacewar! is considered one of the first recognized video games that enjoyed wider distribution behind a single exhibition system. Developed in 1961 for the PDP-1 mainframe computer at MIT, it allowed two players to simulate a space combat fight on the PDP-1's relatively simplistic monitor. The game's source code was shared with other institutions with a PDP-1 across the country as the MIT students moved about, allowing it to gain popularity.
            The history of video games began in the 1950s and 1960s as computer scientists began designing simple games and simulations on minicomputers and mainframes. Spacewar! was developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) student hobbyists in 1962 as one of the first such games on a video display. The first consumer video game hardware was released in the early 1970s. The first home video game console is the Magnavox Odyssey, and the first arcade video games are Computer Space and Pong. After its home console conversions, numerous companies sprang up to capture Pong's success in both the arcade and the home by cloning the game, causing a series of boom and bust cycles due to oversaturation and lack of innovation. By the mid-1970s, low-cost programmable microprocessors replaced the discrete transistor–transistor logic circuitry of the early hardware, and the first ROM cartridge-based home consoles arrived, including the Atari Video Computer System (VCS). Coupled with rapid growth in the golden age of arcade video games, including Space Invaders and Pac-Man, the home console market also flourished. The 1983 video game crash in the United States was characterized by a flood of too many games, often of poor or cloned qualities. The sector saw competition from inexpensive personal computers and new types of games being developed for them. The crash prompted Japan's video game industry to take leadership of the market, which had only suffered minor impacts from the crash. Nintendo released its Nintendo Entertainment System in the United States in 1985, helping to rebound the failing video games sector. The latter part of the 1980s and early 1990s included video games driven by improvements and standardization in personal computers and the console war competition between Nintendo and Sega as they fought for market share in the United States. The first major handheld video game consoles appeared in the 1990s, led by Nintendo's Game Boy platform.
            
            </p>In the early 1990s, advancements in microprocessor technology brought two major technology shifts, including the introduction of optical media via CD-ROMs and real-time 3D polygonal graphic rendering. Both aspects were readily incorporated into personal computers and creating a market for graphics cards, including Sony's fledgling PlayStation console line, pushing Sega out of the console hardware market while diminishing Nintendo's role. By the late 1990s, the Internet also gained widespread consumer use, and video games began incorporating online elements. Microsoft entered the console hardware market in the early 2000s with its Xbox line, fearing that Sony's PlayStation positioned as a game console and entertainment device, would displace personal computers. While Sony and Microsoft continued developing the hardware of comparable top-end console features, Nintendo focused on innovative gameplay. Nintendo developed the Wii with motion-sensing controls, which helped draw in non-traditional players and helped to resecure Nintendo's position in the industry; Nintendo followed this model in the release of the Nintendo Switch.
            From the 2000s and into the 2010s, the industry has seen a shift of demographics as mobile gaming on smartphones and tablets displaced handheld consoles, and casual gaming became an increasing larger sector of the market, as well as a growth in the number of players from China and other areas not traditionally tied to the industry. Traditional revenue models were supplanted with ongoing revenue stream models such as free-to-play, freemium, and subscription-based games to take advantage of these shifts. As triple-A video game production became more costly and risk-averse, opportunities for more experimental and innovative independent game development grew over the 2000s and 2010s, aided by the popularity of mobile and casual gaming and the ease of digital distribution. Hardware and software technology continued to drive improvement in video games, supporting high-definition video at high framerates and virtual and augmented reality-based games.

        <h3>Controller History</h3>
        <p>Controllers have grown so exponentially over the years that we are now able to really and truly FEEL what we are doing which only deepens our connection to the game world that we are in. 
            One of the first video game controllers was a simple dial and single button, used to control the game Tennis for Two. Controllers have since evolved to include directional pads, multiple buttons, analog sticks, joysticks, motion detection, touch screens and a plethora of other features.
            Game controllers have been designed and improved over the years to be as user friendly as possible. The Microsoft Xbox controller, with its shoulder triggers that mimic actual triggers such as those found on guns, has become popular for shooting games.
            Before the seventh generation of video game consoles, plugging in a controller into one of a console's controller ports was the primary means of using a game controller, although since then they have been replaced by wireless controllers, which do not require controller ports on the console but are battery-powered. USB game controllers could also be connected to a computer with a USB port.</p>
          </p>  Types of Controllers: 
            •	Gamepad
            •	Paddle
            •	Joystick
            •	Trackball
            •	Throttle Quadrant
            •	Steering wheel
            •	Yoke
            •	Pedals
            •	Mouse and Keyboard
            •	Touchscreen
            •	Motion sensing
            •	Light gun
            •	Rhythm game controllers
            •	Wireless
