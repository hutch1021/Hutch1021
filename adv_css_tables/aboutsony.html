        <h2>Sony Playstation and Incredible Games</h2>
            <p>Some of my FAVORITE games have been played on Playstation Consoles going all the way back to the PS1.
                I want to showcase some of those influential games below, as well as show you the history of Sony's consoles. I will restrain, as I could write a lot here.
                Even their handheld consoles, specifically the PSP, was always SO much fun to play. Not all of the games listed 
                below are Sony Exclusives which should be mentioned, however, I find playing them on Sony Consoles is a much better experience</p>

<h1>My Favorite PS Games</h1>
<H2>Grand Theft Auto</H2>
<p>From an early age (probably too early) I discovered a little game called Grand Theft Auto.
    It was unlike anything I had ever played. You could do things that no other game allowed. 
    Over the years, more were released. Grand Theft Auto III and GTA: Vice City were constantly 
    on repeat for me.I have enjoyed playing each new one that has emerged. We have been waiting 
    almost 10 years for a new one and I certainly hope to hear news on GTA 6 soon.</p>

<h2>Max Payne</h2>
<p>Max Payne is a relentless story-driven game about a man on the edge, fighting to clear his name while struggling to uncover the truth about his slain family amongst a myriad of plot-twists and twisted thugs in the gritty bowels of New York during the century's worst blizzard.</p>

<H2>The Last of Us</H2>
<p>The Last of Us is one of the most amazing piece of gaming that I have ever came across. The story is incredible and
    the character development is fantastic. HBO recently released a live action TV show which EVERYONE should watch, regardless of if you have played the game.</p>
