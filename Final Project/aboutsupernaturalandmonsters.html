        <h2>Supernatural Monsters</h2>
        <p>Vampires, aliens, and giant sea creatures are all antagonists in the Monster movie genre. Unlike their supernatural counterparts, 
            monsters can wreak havoc on a community of people in one fell swoop. Monsters terrorize and kill whatever is in their path and use 
            their strength and size to destroy. Universal Studios popularized the monster genre in Hollywood from the 1930s and ‘50s with 
            Frankenstein, Dracula, the Creature of the Black Lagoon, and many other iconic monsters. Before Universal found success in making 
            horror films, it wasn’t considered a big player during Hollywood’s early years. Once they discovered that audiences loved to be 
            thrilled and simultaneously terrorized by giant monsters, the studio built a media franchise around their monster movies. 
            Today, when you visit the Universal Studios backlot, you’ll see a giant mural with popular monsters painted on an outdoor wall.</p>

            <h1> Monster Movie History 
            </h1>
                <p>A monster movie, monster film, creature feature or giant monster film is a film that focuses on one or more characters 
                    struggling to survive attacks by one or more antagonistic monsters, often abnormally large ones. The film may also fall 
                    under the horror, comedy, fantasy, or science fiction genres. Monster movies originated with adaptations of horror folklore 
                    and literature. Typically, movie monsters differ from more traditional antagonists in that many exist due to circumstances 
                    beyond their control; their actions are not entirely based on choice, potentially making them objects of sympathy to film 
                    viewers.</p>

                <p>The first feature-length films to include what are regarded as monsters were often classed as horror or science fiction films. The 1915 German silent film The Golem, directed by Paul Wegener, is one of the earliest examples of film to include a creature. The German Expressionist Nosferatu in 1922, and the depiction of a dragon in Fritz Lang's Die Nibelungen in 1924, followed tradition. In the 1930s, American film studios began to produce more successful films of this type, usually based on Gothic tales such as Dracula and Frankenstein in 1931, both heavily influenced by German Expressionism, followed by The Mummy (1932) and The Invisible Man (1933). Classified as horror films, they included iconic monsters.</p>

                <p>Special effects animator Willis O'Brien worked on the 1925 fantasy adventure The Lost World, based on the novel of the same name. The book and film featured dinosaurs, the basis for many future movies. He began work on a similar film known as Creation in 1931, but the project was never completed.[1] Two years later, O'Brien produced special effects for the 1933 RKO film King Kong, directed by Merian C. Cooper. Since then, King Kong has not only become one of the most famous examples of a monster movie, but also is considered a landmark film in the history of cinema. The monster King Kong became a cultural icon, being featured in many other films and media since then. </p>
                
                <p>King Kong went on to inspire many other films of its genre and aspiring animators. A notable example was Ray Harryhausen,[3] who would work with Willis O’Brien on Mighty Joe Young in 1949. Following the re-release of King Kong in 1952, Harryhausen would later work on The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms in 1953. The film was about a fictional dinosaur, a Rhedosaurus, that was awakened from frozen ice in the Arctic Circle by an atomic bomb test. It is considered to be the film which kick-started the 1950s wave of “creature features” and the concept of combining nuclear paranoia with the genre.[4] Such films at the time included Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), Them! (1954), It Came from Beneath the Sea (1955), Tarantula! (1955), The Deadly Mantis (1957) and 20 Million Miles to Earth (1957). The Giant Behemoth (1959) was an unacknowledged remake of The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. </p>
                <p>During the 1950s, Japanese film studio Toho produce their first successful kaiju films. Their first successful kaiju film was Godzilla (1954), which adapted the nuclear concept from The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms from a Japanese perspective, rooted in real-life Japanese historical events, such as the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 and the Daigo Fukuryū Maru incident in 1954.[5][6] The film's success spawned the Godzilla franchise, the longest-running film franchise in history. The titular monster has become a cultural icon, and one of the most recognizable monsters in cinema history. It also inspired a wave of kaiju films, such as Rodan from this time. </p>
                <p>Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956), a re-edited Americanized version of Godzilla for the North American market, notably inspired Steven Spielberg when he was a youth. He described Godzilla as "the most masterful of all the dinosaur movies" because "it made you believe it was really happening." </p>
                <p>A parallel development during this era was the rise of the Z movie, films made outside the organized motion picture industry with ultra-low budgets. Grade-Z monster movies such as Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) and The Creeping Terror (1964) are often listed among the worst films ever made because of their inept acting and amateurish special effects. </p>
                <p>After 1960, American monster movies were less popular, yet were still produced. However, Japanese kaiju films were popular during this decade. In 1962, King Kong vs. Godzilla was a kaiju film produced by Toho featuring both Godzilla and King Kong. In 1965, Japanese studio Kadokawa Pictures started their own kaiju franchise to rival that of Godzilla, in the form of Gamera. </p>
                <p>The Monster Times film magazine was founded in 1972. In 1973, The Monster Times conducted a poll to determine the most popular screen monster. Godzilla was voted the most popular movie monster, beating Count Dracula, King Kong, the Wolf Man, the Mummy, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and Frankenstein's monster. </p>
                
                <p>In 1975, Steven Spielberg directed Jaws, which while labeled as a "thriller", features a large, animatronic great white shark. Jaws was an aquatic monster movie influenced by earlier monster films such as King Kong and Godzilla.[9] Jaws is one of the few monster movies based on a real incident: the New Jersey shark-attacks of 1916 (from which Peter Benchley got the idea for the story). Director John Guillermin remade King Kong in 1976. The xenomorph alien had its first appearance in the 1979 science-fiction/horror film Alien, directed by Ridley Scott. That was the same year when magazine Fangoria started being published, in response to the popularity of this genre. </p>
                
                <p>Since the mid-1970s, with Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, and into the 1980s, monster movies like Larry Cohen's Q, the Winged Serpent (1982), Tom Holland's Fright Night (1985), George Romero's Creepshow (1982) and Ron Underwood's Tremors (1990) used comedy as a scaring device. Just before the technological revolution that made possible to create digital special effects thanks to CGI, the last generation of SFX artists impressed many with the quality and realism of their creations: Rick Baker, Stan Winston and Rob Bottin are among the most remarkable names in the industry. </p>
                
                <p>1993 saw the release of Jurassic Park, based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton and directed by Steven Spielberg, which set a new benchmark in the genre with innovative use of CGI and tried-and-tested animatronics to recreate dinosaurs. The film was also influenced by Godzilla.[7] Jurassic Park was an enormous critical and commercial success and at one point held the title of the highest-grossing film of all time. </p>
                
                <p>The success of Jurassic Park and its four sequels, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), Jurassic Park III (2001), Jurassic World (2015), and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), made sure that dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex and the Velociraptor established themselves in the public psyche. The movies also helped generate renewed interest in paleontology. While the films showed allegedly authentic dinosaurs which had been recreated by genetic engineering and could be understood as science fiction, advanced contemporary animation technology made it also possible to revive medieval legends about dragons. The successful feature film Dragonheart (1996) showed a friendly dragon voiced by Sean Connery. </p>
                
                <p>Traditional monster movies re-emerged to a wider audience during the late 1990s. An American remake of Godzilla was made in 1998. The Godzilla featured in that film was considerably different from the original and many Godzilla fans disliked it, but it was a box office success. In 2002, a French monster film Brotherhood of the Wolf (2001) became the second-highest-grossing French-language film in the United States in the last two decades. In 2004, Godzilla was temporarily retired following Godzilla: Final Wars. Director Peter Jackson, inspired by the original King Kong and Ray Harryhausen films, remade King Kong in 2005, which was both a critical and commercial success. In 2006, a South Korean monster film, The Host, involved more political overtones than most of its genre. </p>
                
                <p>The 2008 monster movie, Cloverfield, a story in the vein of classic monster movies, focuses entirely on the perspective and reactions of the human cast and is regarded by some as a look at terrorism and the September 11 attacks metaphorically. The following year The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep (2007) was released, in which the legendary Loch Ness Monster is portrayed as a playful creature menaced by overly aggressive humans. The British Independent Film Award-winning film Monsters, in a manner similar to Cloverfield, presented the story of a monster epidemic from the perspective of the humans affected by it. Although not entirely focused on monsters, blockbusters such as The Avengers and Prometheus included scenes that featured monsters posing threats to the protagonists. </p>
                
                <p>In 2013, Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures released the Guillermo del Toro film Pacific Rim. Though the film was heavily inspired by the kaiju and Mecha anime genres, del Toro wished to create something original with the film rather than to reference previous work. The film was a moderate success in the United States but a box office hit overseas. It received generally positive reviews with significant praise for the film's special effects. A sequel, Pacific Rim Uprising, was released in 2018. </p>
                
                <p>In 2014, Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures released Godzilla, a reboot of the Godzilla franchise directed by Gareth Edwards. Legendary originally intended to produce a trilogy with Edwards attached to direct all films. Shortly afterwards, Legendary announced a shared cinematic universe between Godzilla and King Kong, titled MonsterVerse. Two years later in 2016, Toho rebooted the Godzilla franchise with Shin Godzilla.[15] Kong: Skull Island was released in March 2017, a reboot of the King Kong franchise and second film in Legendary's MonsterVerse. The third film in the MonsterVerse, Godzilla: King of the Monsters was released on May 31, 2019. Michael Dougherty directed the film and featured Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah.[16] The fourth film in the MonsterVerse, Godzilla vs. Kong, was released on March 31, 2021. It is directed by Adam Wingard</p>

                <h2>Vampires, and mummies, and werewolves, oh my!</h2>
                <p>These are just a few of the iconic creatures that have captured our rapidly drumming hearts from the glow of the silver screen dating back to the silent era. Frankenstein’s man-made monster; Imhotep, the re-animated mummy; Bram Stoker’s vampire, Dracula; and the Wolf Man, the cursed werewolf, top the list of cinema’s most famous and enduring creatures of fright. It is these unnatural creatures that distinguish classic monster movies from the broader genre in which they reside—horror. </p>
                <p>Horror movies often feature natural beings as the deadly antagonists that send other story characters running for their lives. Examples include humans, such as Hannibal Lecter (Silence of the Lambs, 1991) and Norman Bates (Psycho, 1960). These natural but deadly beings can also be animals, such as dogs (Cujo, 1983), sharks (Jaws, 1975), and even crows and seagulls (The Birds, 1963). But in a true monster movie, the creatures are unnatural, even when they are lizards like Godzilla and apes like King Kong. Although Godzilla and King Kong characters are based on real animals, both are supernatural monsters due to their gargantuan stature and supernatural origins. </p>
                <p>The unnatural creatures that come to us on the big screen typically stem from preternatural folklore or science fiction. For example, Godzilla is a creature born out of nature’s lethal vengeance toward humans and the hubris they exhibited in deploying the atomic bomb. In the case of King Kong, the creature is a product of his environment. He comes from the mythical Skull Island, a place where animals have evolved for millennia with no biological check on bizarre mutations, such as unlimited growth. But regardless of a monster’s origins, they all have something in common: they will cause eyes to slam shut, audible gasps, white-knuckle clutching, and bone-chilling screams. ©ActivityConnection.com – The History of Classic Monster Movies.</p>
                <p>So why do we watch? It seems contradictory that humans, who are known to conduct their daily lives in the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, would pay good money at the box office in order to engross themselves in two hours of terror and disgust. Yet horror movie audiences have been doing just that for nearly a century. And during the month of October, we binge-watch these movies on television! A few theories have emerged to explain why people like horror movies. One is that the emotion these films elicit is excitement rather than actual fear. </p> 
                <p>Another theory is that people are willing to be frightened because they know a euphoric sense of relief is coming when the monster is defeated in the end. But one recent study offers another explanation. The study contradicts a previous assumption—that humans are incapable of experiencing both positive and negative emotions in response to one source of stimulation. Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Florida tracked simultaneous emotional responses and found that people can feel both fear and elation when they are cloaked in a sense of remoteness and protection from the source of the fear. It’s a little like feeling that warm sense of comfort and security we often experience during a thunderstorm that rages outside while we snuggle in a cozy bed. Sitting in a theater with a hundred other people provides the same type of psychological protection from whatever is happening on the screen.</p>
