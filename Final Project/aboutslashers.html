        <h2>Slashers</h2>
        <p>The Slasher. The pinnacle of the golden age. Most people consider the first slasher as Halloween but it actually goes all the way back to a
            little film called Psycho in 1960 (starring the amazing Janet Leigh, Jammie Lee Curtis's mother). There are many slashers that rode the coat tails of
            movies like Halloween throughout the years. A slasher film is a genre of horror films involving a killer stalking and murdering a group of people, 
            usually by use of bladed or sharp tools like knife, chainsaw, scalpel, etc.[1] Although the term "slasher" may occasionally be used informally as a generic term for any horror film involving murder, film analysts cite an established set of characteristics 
            which set slasher films apart from other horror subgenres, such as monster movies, splatter films, supernatural and psychological horror films.
            Critics cite the Italian giallo films and psychological horror films such as Peeping Tom (1960) and Psycho (1960) as early influences.
            The genre hit its peak between 1978 and 1984 in an era referred to as the "Golden Age" of slasher films.[citation needed] Notable slasher films 
            include The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), Black Christmas (1974), Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), 
            Child's Play (1988), Candyman (1992), Scream (1996) and I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997). Many slasher films released decades ago continue to attract cult followings.
            The slasher canon can be divided into three eras: the classical (1974–1993), the self-referential (1994–2000) and the neoslasher cycle (2001–2013).</p>

            <h1> Why Slasher's are my favorite</h1>
                <p>It's no secret that Halloween is my favorite movie, however, I have a love in my heart for all slashers. Slasher films typically 
                    adhere to a specific formula: a past wrongful action causes severe trauma that is reinforced by a commemoration or anniversary 
                    that reactivates or re-inspires the killer.Built around stalk-and-murder sequences, the films draw upon the audience's 
                    feelings of catharsis, recreation, and displacement, as related to sexual pleasure.Paste magazine's definition notes that, 
                    "slasher villains are human beings, or were human beings at some point. Slasher villains are human killers whose actions are 
                    objectively evil, because they’re meant to be bound by human morality. That’s part of the fear that the genre is meant to prey upon, 
                    the idea that killers walk among us. I love this concept and I love a good bloodbath and a bada$$ final girl!</p>
             
       
                <h2>NEVER Underestimate The Final Girl</h2>

                <p>The final girl trope is discussed in film studies as being a young woman (occasionally a young man) left alone to face the 
                    killer's advances in the movie's end. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), the heroine in Halloween, is an example of a 
                    typical final girl. Final girls are often, like Laurie Strode, virgins among sexually active teens. Several slasher film 
                    villains grew to take on villain protagonist characteristics, with the series following the continued efforts of a villain, 
                    rather than the killer's victims (for example, Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Chucky and Leatherface).
                    The Scream film series is a rarity that follows its heroine Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) rather than masked killer 
                    Ghostface, whose identity changes from film to film, and is only revealed in each entry's finale.</p>

                <h2>Slasher Books</h2>
                <p>Normally, I wouldn't mix books in with movies, however, there are a couple of books that go along with the slasher genre. They
                impressed me so much that I have read these over and over and I highly recommend them if you like to read! These books are by Stephen Graham Jones. Of course,
                we all know the "King of Horror", Mr. Stephen King. I highly suggest his books as well, as they helped shape my childhood</p>>
