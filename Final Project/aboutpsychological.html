        <h2>Psychological Horror</h2>
        <p>Psychological horror is not about what we see on the screen but how it makes us feel. This genre plays tricks on the viewers’ mind by 
            creating paranoia. A viewers’ emotional state is heavily influenced by psychological horror. Since this type of horror can feel a 
            little too real compared to the other genres (gore and monsters), people may walk away feeling uneasy. The main characters in these 
            types of horror movies are mentally unstable or emotionally disturbed to the point of being violent. One of the best examples of the 
            psychological horror genre is Stanley Kurbrick’s The Shining starring Jack Nicholoson. From the beginning of the movie you can see 
            Jack Torrence slowly turn more mad with each developing scene.</p>

            <h1> What is it's purpose? 
            </h1>
                <p>Psychological Horror is a subgenre of Horror that aims at creating horrific, paranoiac, suspenseful or unsettling effects through in-depth use of mental and emotional states or psychological conditions.
                    This may involve replacing physical threats with psychological ones (e.g. madness, hallucinations), thorough exploration of 
                    the mind of the disturbed, mentally ill, or unreliable protagonists (including the bad guys/Monster of the Week), 
                    replacing overt displays of horror (monsters, deformed killers) by more subtle, creepy details and an eerie mood or 
                    atmosphere that play on the audience's fears. Often overlaps with Surreal Horror.</p>

                <h2>Beginner’s Guide: Psychological Horror</h2>

                <p>The universal attraction to horror is a complex, rich, and dynamic brew. Dr. Glenn D. Walters identified the primary 
                   motivations behind the drive to watch scary movies: tension, relevance and unrealism. Tension is created through suspense, 
                   terror, gore, mystery and shock. It inspires the desire to be transformed emotionally. Relevance applies to universal fears 
                   (fear of death), issues that a society fears (world-wide plague), or identification with the protagonist (overcoming a traumatic event). Unrealism creates perspective from terrifying situations that ironically allow a closer look at the nature of our fears.
                    Psychological horror is a sub-genre that focuses on the darker side of the human psyche that’s often repressed. It also 
                    explores emotional and psychological vulnerabilities over primal survival fears. These films are designed to be more like 
                    vivid nightmares, sending the conscious mind an important message or warning of something that hasn’t been acknowledged. 
                    These films can also reflect breaking thru social norms to uncover vital aspects of the psyche that are culturally rejected.
                    In psychological horror, suspicion, distrust, self-doubt and paranoia about oneself, others or the world are present. 
                    This is referred to in Jungian psychology as characteristics of the archetypal shadow. These are the emotional and mental 
                    fears that keep people up at night and evoke a sense of dread in everyday life.</p>
                   <p>This sub-genre reveals the complexity of human nature through the use of metaphor. Struggles with monsters, aliens, 
                    supernatural creatures are metaphors for emotional and psychological struggles. Characters are battling their own inner demons. Resolutions are complex, complicated, and unexpected. The villain may get away. The protagonist may have to learn how to live with a monster or disappear completely into madness. These films are often light on gore and “I couldn’t sleep alone for a week!” scares. They rely more on atmosphere, subtle creepy details, suggestion, and ambiguity.
                    Plot twists are an important element. Surprise is used to deepen exploration of the film’s theme. Traditional horror often 
                    follows the straight line of a fight for survival. In psychological horror, what’s terrifying is understanding why everything 
                    is not what it seems. Processing the experience of death is a major theme in psychological horror, especially when it’s 
                    against societal or familial expectations. This type of horror creeps up where reality and taboo meet. 
                    Humans are a mixture of primal truths and social conditioning. Psychological horror explores what’s created when there is a 
                    disastrous dissidence between these expectations and the natural stages of grief. Ghosts in this sub-genre are looking for 
                    complex things. The undead represent the physiological experience of being physically alive but animated by a force that is 
                    void of humanity. Protagonists are often the dead or undead, lending to exploration of their psyche.</p>

                <h2>The Debate: What Are The Psycological Effects of Horror Movies? </h2>
                <p>Horror movies contain psychological tricks that create illusions of suspense and danger through the manipulation of images, sound, and story.Although your brain is aware that the threats aren’t real, your body simultaneously registers them as if they are.
                    <p>Sally Winston, licensed psychologist and executive director of the Anxiety and Stress Disorders Institute of Maryland, explains, “[When watching horror films], your heart pumps and the adrenaline flows, and your attention narrows in, even as you know you are at home or in the theatre and there is no real danger.”</p>
                    
                    <p>This is similar to being on an amusement park ride, where you can feel terrified while at the same time knowing you’re safe.Winston says that generally speaking, there’s no harm in watching for those who can process the illusion for what it is. She describes the ability to have an experience and simultaneously observe it as “defusion” or “disentanglement.”It’s a “prerequisite for enjoying horror movies,” she says.That said, there are some things to be mindful of. </p>
                    
                    <p>Horror films are designed to elicit certain emotions such as tension, fear, stress, and shock. These can cause the release of the hormones in the body such as norepinephrine, cortisol, and adrenaline from the autonomic nervous system. You may notice a physiological response from these hormones by way of pupil dilation, increased heart rate, and muscle tension. </p>
                    <p>Although adrenaline contributes to the overall experience of the movie, the elevated states can make it harder to sleep. “Even the post-horror euphoria some feel is activating, not relaxing. Thus, even for those who enjoy the emotional roller coaster, horror and suspense films can make it harder to sleep,” says Dr. Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center. Getting a good night’s sleep is incredibly important for both physical and mental health. </p>
                    <p>People who suffer from anxiety are more likely to be negatively impacted by horror films. As Rutledge explains, “Chronic anxiety increases the sensitivity to startle-eliciting stimuli, thus making people who are already stressed and anxious more likely to respond negatively.” Anxiety sensitivityTrusted Source is the fear of the bodily sensations associated with anxiety and a misinterpretation of these sensations as being real threats.Winston explains this as “the fear of fear — an aversion to, and fear of, the body’s arousal response through sensations and feelings.”Those that suffer from anxiety sensitivity are more likely to experience a negative impact from watching horror films. The tendency to fear intrusive thoughts and images may be triggered and increase levels of anxiety or panic. Winston notes that watching horror images could lead to unwanted thoughts and feelings, so there’s usually a major urge in those who experience anxiety sensitivity to avoid such experiences. </p>
                    
                    <p>What about the Positive effects of horror films? Despite being full of guts and gore, horror films can have positive effects on viewers too.Rutledge says, “Generally, people who watch horror films tend to enjoy them for a variety of reasons, so for most viewers, it is a positive impact.” Watching horror films can also be an opportunity to confront one’s fears as the viewer withstands the horror and gets to enjoy the payoff of resolution. This can be especially true for viewers with certain mental health disorders.“If someone is being treated for an anxiety disorder or OCD, horror movies can provide useful opportunities to face one’s fears and develop the confidence that you can, in fact, endure unpleasant distress, and that it’s not dangerous to you,” Winston explains.However, it’s important to talk to your doctor or a licensed psychologist about whether this would work for you personally. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p>Tips for healthy viewing. There are also ways to lessen the impact of a scary movie while still enjoying the thrill.Find out what subgenre suits you. An important tip to watching horror films is to find what level you can handle and what subgenre suits your preferences. As Rutledge says, “Know your own taste and tolerance.”For example, not everyone is going to enjoy gore or mind games. If bloodshed is more likely to haunt you long after viewing, try something more supernatural, like “Paranormal Activity” or “The Conjuring.”Alternatively, if ghosts are more likely to keep you up at night, try opting for a psychological thriller such as “Black Swan,” “The Boy Next Door,” or “Look Away.” If gore is your cup of tea, try “Human Centipede” or the “Saw” series. </p>
                    <p>Set boundaries for yourself. The most important thing to keep in mind when watching horror films is your own comfort. “There’s no harm in avoiding horror movies, whether it’s in response to a moral value eschewing violence or a psychological desire to avoid unwanted images and sensations,” says Winston. Rutledge agrees with this sentiment of putting your needs first.“Be prepared to set boundaries and stick up for yourself when negotiating shared programming. Don’t subject yourself to discomfort because others want to watch something you may find upsetting,” she says. It’s important to assess your current emotions and how you’ll be impacted by what’s on-screen, especially if you have a tendency toward fear or anxiety. As Rutledge notes, “If you’re finding yourself short-tempered and anxious… forego a horror film and watch something that lets you escape into another world. Remember, you can always leave the room and pick up a relaxing book instead. All narratives have conflict, but it’s about picking the level that feels right for you at the time. </p>
