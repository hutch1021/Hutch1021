        <h2>Demon Posession</h2>
        <p>There is no shortage of creepy films about demons, ghosts, and possession. These movies tend to leave us feeling a little disturbed.
            If you are a believer in the paranormal, then you are pronbably drawn to these types of movies. Sometimes thought of as supernatural 
            horror, this subgenre plays into the unknown of the human experience. Demons have been part of historical storytelling for centuries. 
            They represent evil in many forms including mythical, religious and supernatural. One of the most known demonic movie examples of all 
            time is William Friedkin’s 1973 movie The Exorcist. Pazuzu, the main demon, is never actually mentioned in the movie, but is arguably 
            the best-known demon of today’s horror movies. As the star character in The Exorcist, Pazuzu is an ancient mythological demon in 
            Mesopotamia who possessed Regan MacNeil played by Linda Blair. The movie skyrocketed Pazuzu to Hollywood fame and helped shape the 
            demonic genre of horror in modern moviemaking. There are several sub genres that fall under this category as you will see below</p>

            <h1> Paranormal</h1>
                <p>Paranormal horror is closely related to the demonic subgenre in that it focuses on characters who aren’t living beings. 
                    Spirits and ghosts spook viewers and create fear without a physical presence on screen. For example, furniture moves without 
                    anyone touching it or a chill passes through the air out of nowhere. Those are elements of paranormal activity that can be 
                    from a demon spirit, supernatural power or ghost. Paranormal Activity, The Conjuring, The Amityville Horror, The Omen, Carrie, 
                    and Poltergeist are all examples from the Paranormal subgenre.</p>

                <h2>Witchcraft</h2>

                <p>Witches have a long history of mischief in folklore. They use the power of magic to cast spells on their victims turning them 
                    into all kinds of tortured beings. Similar to the paranormal genre, witchcraft uses supernatural elements to create fear. 
                    Movies like The Witch and Susperia are great examples of the terror caused by witches..</p>

                <h2>Fun Facts: Cursed Films</h2>
                <p>The captivating series delves into the myths and legends behind some of Hollywood’s notoriously “cursed” horror film productions. 
                    From the mysterious accidents that took place on the set of The Exorcist, to bombings during the making of The Omen and the 
                    rumoured use of human skeletons on the set of Poltergeist… these stories are legendary amongst film fans and filmmakers alike. 
                    But is there truth in the tales? I highly recommend checking out this series. It details the spooky happenings that occured on 
                    the sets of some of the films mentioned on this page.</p>
