            <h1> Brief Overview of The Horror Film</h1>
                <p>Horror is a film genre that seeks to elicit fear or disgust in its audience for entertainment.
                These films often explore dark subject matter and may deal with transgressive topics or themes. Broad elements include monsters, apocalyptic events, and religious or folk beliefs. Cinematic techniques used in horror films have been shown to provoke psychological reactions in an audience.
                Horror films have existed for more than a century. 
                <p>Early inspirations from before the development of film include folklore, religious beliefs and superstitions of different cultures, and the Gothic and horror literature of authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley. From origins in silent films and German Expressionism, the horror only became a codified genre after the release of Dracula (1931). Many sub-genres emerged in subsequent decades, including body horror, comedy horror, slasher films, supernatural horror, and psychological horror. The genre has been produced worldwide, varying in content and style between regions. 
                The earliest horror movies drew themes and imagery from literature stretching back centuries. Many ever-present horror features, such as ghosts, demons, zombies, monsters, madness, and apocalyptic events, were already well-established in ancient folklore and texts from around the world. Sources include Ancient Greek and Roman texts and even the Bible.
                In the 1890s, advances in cinematography coincided with the publication of many classically dark works of fiction, such as "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” "Dracula,” and "The Picture of Dorian Gray.” 
                These developments influenced what is widely regarded as the first horror film.</p>
             
                <p>If you’re exploring the history of horror movies, you need context. Horror films don’t exist in a vacuum, nor are they based on a fixed set of ideas. They evolve with the zeitgeist, reflecting and provoking pop culture discourse. Horror offers us a fictional space in which we can share and evaluate our collective fears – whatever they may be at the time. Scary movies allow us to stare down whichever one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse – Pestilence, War, Famine, Death – is currently leading the charge. They also let us examine the darkest possibilities of new concepts in science and technology. Despite religious and government censorship, they serve a wider moral purpose, reinforcing social taboos and demonstrating the macabre fate of those who transgress against our collective rules.

                    Audiences, especially the youthful 15-24 demographic that has shaped horror since the 1950s, evolve too. We continually seek out new thrills and fresh scares. New horror movies must be relevant, or risk losing their bite: what was terrifying yesterday might seem a non-issue tomorrow. Generation by generation, we work through our shared traumas and move on to the next iteration. In the 1970s, people worried about mutations in unborn babies triggered by thalidomide or Agent Orange. Today, that threat is forgotten and we’re much more concerned about the damage caused in utero by microplastics.</p>
                <p>Despite frequent hand wringing about its demise, the horror genre is a cultural constant. We’ve terrified each other with tales that trigger the less logical parts of our imaginations for as long as we’ve told stories. From the ballads of the ancient world to modern urban myths, audiences flock to sadistic storytellers to be scared witless –and remain happy to pay for the privilege. Over the past century or more, horror movies have consistently succeeded at the box office. As the horrors of climate change, over-population, income inequality, and who knows what else loom on the horizon, they won’t be fading away any time soon</p>
       
                <h2>Fun Facts: The "Rules" of Surviving a Horror Movie</h2>

                <p>1.
                    Don't Ever Investigate Or Say You'll "Be Right Back"
                    Thirsty? Ask for a sip of someone else’s drink. Forgot something in the woods? Cut your losses. Hear a strange noise in the basement? Pretend you don’t. Whatever you do, just don’t announce a quick detour from your group or it’ll be your swan song. The “I’ll be right back” trope has become such a horror flick death scene precursor that viewers almost find themselves rooting for the masked assailant to punish the never-to-returnee. No, you won’t be right back. You’ll be bloody and hanging from the garage door’s doggy hole.</p>
                    
                <p>    2.
                    Turn Around, Because It's Always Behind You
                    While hiding from the deranged, knife-wielding thing of evil, you might ask yourself, “Where is it?” Answer: Right behind you. Learn from those who have gone before you. In 1991’s The Silence of the Lambs, FBI trainee Clarice Starling at least had the foresight to bring a gun into the sadistic serial killer’s lair. Clarice barely made it out of the basement alive. You won’t. Just ask the cast of The Cellar.</p>
                    
                 <p>   3.
                    Never Watch A Horror Movie When You're In One
                    If your slasher movie night starts to seem eerily autobiographical, immediately turn on the lights and make sure all the kitchen knives are accounted for. If there have been any recent reports of asylum breakouts or mysterious demonic rituals, stay away from scary movies. You’re probably in one. Actually, stay away from all screens. Poltergeist and The Ring all had sequels for a reason.</p>
                    
                 <p>   4.
                    Make Sure Your Car is Always in Perfect Working Order
                    If you’re able to escape that masked killer, remember that cars typically aren’t reliable. Battery life always yields to the strange and inconvenient horror time continuum, a force that’s always sure to leave you stranded in your moment of need. Or in your moment of zombie horde attack. Before leaving the driveway, make sure you bring an extra set of keys (the first are sure to be lost during the initial attack) and consider a preemptive visit to a mechanic…who is probably an axe murderer anyway.</p>
                    
                    <p>   5.
                    Don't Ever Split Up
                    Most of us learned this lesson as 5-year-olds, shaking our heads at reruns of Scooby Doo as Shaggy and Scooby ran in circles away from spooks while the rest of the gang gathered clues. Those that didn’t might end up like the cast of The House on Haunted Hill (if you’re lucky, the tamer 1959 version), being picked off one by one by the movie monster of the week. “Strength in numbers” might be a tired cliche, but its more appealing than “dead as a doornail.”</p>
                    
                    <p>   6.
                    When Haunted, Just Move Out of the Damn House
                    If you (or one of your children) can offer any kind of credible proof that the grand old house you just purchased for cheap is haunted, drop the caulk gun and get out. We’ve seen too many families attempt to stick a haunting out: The Amityville Horror, The Shining, Paranormal Activity. Your attempts to shun the dead will prove futile as evil spirits use you for a nice game of possess and kill. Just sell the house and take the loss, okay?</p>
                    
                    <p>    7.
                    Wear Comfortable Shoes
                    Received any threatening phone calls lately? Any cryptic messages scrawled in blood after the murder of your best friend? You’re probably next. Fright nights rarely allow for wardrobe changes, so wear comfortable footwear the first time around, even for formal events. As much fun as it is watching Sarah Michelle Gellar attempt to run from a hook-wielding fisherman in a beauty pageant getup, it doesn’t mean you should repeat her mistakes. Combat boots only, ladies.</p>
                    
                    <p>   8.
                    Avoid Proms and All Other High School Parties
                    Proms should be avoided at all costs, in case of vampire attack, revenge killings or the occasional prom queen who possesses the ability to slaughter with her mind. Large gatherings of teenagers are like cat nip for the murderously inclined, so why heighten the appeal with boutonnieres and push up bras? Don’t go to the prom. The pictures are always bad anyway.</p>
                    
                    <p>   9.
                    Always Assume Your Attacker Is Still Alive
                    Ah yes, the suspenseful conclusion. If you’re lucky enough to make this far you’ve probably pulled some highly unrealistic Rambo move on your killer at the last second. Your attacker lies motionless on the floor. You let out a big sigh of relief and let your guard down. Big mistake. 2009’s Zombieland covers what to do in these situations with a move called “the double tap.” Always deliver a second fatal blow to ensure your assailant is dead because they’ll surely always come back for more.</p>
       
                    <p> 10. Keep Your Pants On
                        If you have sex, you die. In teen horror movies, those who couple off for a lusty moment or two usually end up losing more than their shirts. Friday the 13th features an entire cast of randy teen camp counselors who are dismembered one by one as they sneak off to earn the film its R rating, most only living a few minutes past their trysts before they’re greeted with an ax to the face. If you want to up your odds of survival, keep your virginity intact and your clothes on. As Psycho proved, even showers aren’t safe. Best to bathe clothed.</p>

            <h1>Subgenre's of Horror</h1>
            <p>There are many ways to shock, scare and disgust people, so the horror genre is broad and varied. Movies are often described as belonging to one of many sub-genres/ Some of those are:</p>
             
            <ul>
           <li> Body Horror:
            These movies disturb by subjecting human bodies to grotesque transformations by such means as mutation, mutilation, or invasion. Often this involves some kind of creature or disease, such as in the 1986 hit "The Fly" or 2014's "Tusk".</li>
           <img src="Images for final project/Main Page/Tusk.jpg" alt="tusk">
            <li>Comedy Horror:
            The ability to laugh at one’s fears is a powerful draw for those who prefer some relief from tension and gore. "Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil" fuses fear and laughter brilliantly.</li>
           <img src="Images for final project/Main Page/Tucker and Dale.jpg" alt="Tucker and Dale">
            <li> Monster Movies:
            The monster in these films is often a non-human entity that’s not responsible for its creation and actions - which usually involve the destruction of the human race. </li>
            <img src="Images for final project/Main Page/Monster Movies.jpg" alt="Monster Movies">
            <li>Aliens:
            Few scenes in all of cinema are as iconic as when that serpent-like creature bursts from the chest of John Hurt’s astronaut in 1979’s "Alien"</li>
            <img src="Images for final project/Main Page/Alien.jpg" alt="Alien">
            <li>Creatures:
            Sometimes, there’s no need to create fantastical grotesque beasts. In the right hands, the natural world is scary enough, as Alfred Hitchcock demonstrated in "The Birds".</li> 
           <img src="Images for final project/Main Page/The Birds (Creatures).jpg" alt="The Birds">
            <li>Vampires:
            "Dracula", the 1897 novel by Bram Stoker, has spawned over 170 film adaptations. The infamous Bloodsucker has stalked the big screen for over a hundred years.</li>
           <img src="Images for final project/Main Page/Dracula.jpg" alt="Dracula">
            <li>Zombies:
            While George A. Romero’s "Night of the Living Dead" revolutionized the horror genre, perhaps his 1978 sequel "Dawn of the Dead" is the better film. Avoiding hordes of undead of course brings plenty of nail-biting intensity, but it also seems to provide a blank canvas for character studies, topical satire, and tales of adventure.</li>
           <img src="Images for final project/Main Page/Dawn of the Dead.jpg" alt="Zombies">
            <li>Psychological Horror:
            Rather than fearsome monsters or brutal gore, these films create fear by delving into the darker corners of the mind. They often involve characters losing their grip on reality, emotional manipulation, or even mental disorders. The power of these films lies in the fact that they play on real fears and emotions - it could happen to us. Perhaps "The Shining", a 1980 adaption of the Stephen King novel, is the most notable example of psychological horror, as it depicts Jack Nicholson’s character descending into madness.</li>
           <img src="Images for final project/Main Page/Hannibal (pyschological).jpg" alt="hannibal">
            <li>Slasher Films:
            These formulaic films became incredibly popular in the 1980s. Typically, an unknown villain would pursue a group (usually teens) and kill them one by one with a bladed weapon. Often, an event from the past would link them all together. Popular slashers include "Friday the 13", "Scream", and "I Know What You Did Last Summer".</li>
           <img src="Images for final project/Main Page/Slasher Victor Crowly.jpg" alt="Slasher Victor Crawley">
            <li>Horror (Gore):
            A term first used by George A. Romero in reference to "Dawn of the Dead", it’s since been used to describe any film that contains graphic mutilations of the human body. While the genre has been around since the 1960s, it saw its greatest popularity in the 2000s with films like "Saw" and "Hostel".</li>
           <img src="Images for final project/Main Page/Hostel  (splatter).jpg" alt="Splatter Hostel">
            <li>Demonic Possession:
            Even though it was released in 1973, "The Exorcist" still has the power to shock viewers today with its depiction of a young girl whose body is inhabited by a demon.</li>
            <img src="Images for final project/Main Page/The Omen.jpg" alt="The Omen">
            <li>Ghosts and Spirits:
            Often these films create fear and suspense without actually showing audiences much - noises in the dark, objects moving without explanation, strange symbols appearing, and so on. ‘Found-footage’ films do this particularly well. "The Blair Witch Project" was hugely successful in 1999 and paved the way for the later success of "Paranormal Activity".</li>
